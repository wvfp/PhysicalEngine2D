# PhysicalEngine2D
## About
- A 2D physics engine written in C++
- It is a simple engine that simulates rigid body dynamics, including collision detection and response.
- It is designed to be easy to use and understand, making it a great choice for learning about physics engines and game development.
- It is for construct my 2D game engine.
## Features
- Rigid body dynamics
- Collision detection and response
- Simple and easy to use API
- Supports multiple shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon)
- Supports multiple collision detection algorithms (AABB, SAT)
- Supports multiple physics materials (friction, restitution)
- Supports multiple physics constraints (distance, angle)
- Supports multiple physics forces (gravity, wind)
- Supports multiple physics integrators (Euler, Verlet)
- Supports multiple physics solvers (Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi)
- Supports multiple physics time steps (fixed, variable)
## Example
- The example program demonstrates how to use the engine to create a simple simulation of a falling box.
- It creates a box and applies gravity to it, causing it to fall to the ground.
- It also demonstrates how to use the engine's collision detection and response system to handle collisions between the box and the ground.
- The example program is located in the `example` directory.
## Installation
- Clone the repository
- Create a build directory
- Run CMake to generate the build files
- Build the project using make
- Install the library using make install
- Run the example program using ./example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wvfp/PhysicalEngine2D.git
cd PhysicalEngine2D
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```
